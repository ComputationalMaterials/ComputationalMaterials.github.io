## About

Computational Materials at Berkeley, or *CM@B*, was founded as an avenue to inform the public and students at the University of California, Berkeley about advancements in the fascinating field of computational materials science. We host a number of different events each semester including networking events, skill-building workshops, and talks by world-renowned experts in the cutting-edge intersection of high performance computing and materials science.

Because of our club's outreach basis, many companies have recognized Computational Materials at Berkeley as an excellent way to reach out to graduate students and participate in both sponsorship and hosted events.
