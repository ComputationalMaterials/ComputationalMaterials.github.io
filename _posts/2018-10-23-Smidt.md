### Time: Tuesday, October 23, 2018
### Location will be announced soon.

We are extremely delighted to be able to host the 2018 Luis W. Alvarez Fellow in Computing Sciences, Tess Smidt, for a talk on campus this October. Tess has made significant contributions to the use of machine learning in materials science and was part of Googleâ€™s "Accelerated Science Team" during her PhD in Jeff Neaton's group at Berkeley. In her talk she'll describe her experiences working at Google and how she found projects during her PhD.
