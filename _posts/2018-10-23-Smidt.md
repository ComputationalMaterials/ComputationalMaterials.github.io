# CM@B Speaker Series
## Tess Smidt: Software Tools, Crystal Descriptors, and Applications of Machine Learning Applied to Materials Design
### Time: Tuesday, October 23, 2018
### Location will be announced soon.

We are extremely delighted to be able to host the 2018 Luis W. Alvarez Fellow in Computing Sciences, Tess Smidt, for a talk on campus this October. Tess has made significant contributions to the use of machine learning in materials science and was part of Google’s "Accelerated Science Team" during her PhD in Jeff Neaton's group at Berkeley. In her talk she'll describe her experiences working at Google and how she found projects during her PhD.
