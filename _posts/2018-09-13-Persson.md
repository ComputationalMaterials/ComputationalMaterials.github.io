# CM@B Speaker Series
## Kristin Persson: The Materials Project.
### Time: 2pm Thursday, September 13, 2018
### Location will be announced soon.

Since launching in 2011, the [Materials Project](www.materialsproject.org), a Department of Energy program based at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has been on the forefront of materials informatics with a giant, searchable repository of data available to the whole materials science community. We're pleased to announce that the director of the Materials Project, Professor Kristin Persson, will join us on September 13th to speak about the Materials Project and how high-throughput density functional theory and databases of computed materials properties have revolutionized materials science as we know it today.
