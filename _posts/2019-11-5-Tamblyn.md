# CM@B Speaker Series
## Isaac Tamblyn: Physics and AI: Achieving Transferability in Deep Learning from Minimal Observations
### Time: 4-5pm
### 290 Hearst Memorial Mining Building

Dr. Isaac Tamblyn is a Research Officer for the National Research Council of Canada.  His research focuses on applying computational methods to applied problems in material science. Recently, his group has been focused on applying the tools of data science to the problem of materials. He is particularly interested in using recent advances in deep learning and A.I. to develop computationally tractable solutions to hard problems in condensed matter physics, with a focus on applications in the space of renewable energy materials.
